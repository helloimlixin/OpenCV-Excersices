# Question

ColorImage.cpp is a program that takes a look at colorspace conversions in OpenCV. Run the code in ColorImage.cpp and comment on the outputs. Implement the same thing in Python and save each image.

# Answer

The first output of ColorImage.cpp is the original image. For the later outputs, each one shows a distinct channel of the original image:
* RGB shows the Red, Green and Blue channels of the original image respectively; 
* For YIQ, Y, Cb, Cr shows the luminance, blue and red color differences respectively; for 
* For HSV, H, S and V shows the hue, saturation and value channels of the original image respectively.
